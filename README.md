Datas from the Newsie Dev side

For now, manually-curated data journalism stories that have released their data and/or their code. Later: attempts to reproduce, critique, and extend the work.

Good places to look for stuff (as I note them down):

- https://github.com/datanews/
- https://github.com/buzzfeednews
- https://github.com/propublica
- https://github.com/theupshot

I fork repos over to https://github.com/newsiedev
